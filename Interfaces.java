public interface Interfaces {

    // what is interface:
    //it is same as class but interface will have only methods but not the body.
//    example
    // public void getData(){}- only method not body in it

    /*public void getData();
    public void rawData();
    public void noData();
    */


    // when we inherit the interfaces, we implements the parent class in child class
    // public class child implements parent class
    // we would have to use all the methods of interface in child class we can cot skip any method.
